Hi, I'm **Tarvinder Singh** — a Cloud Architect and platform Leader with over 11 years of experience delivering scalable, automated cloud solutions across AWS, Azure and hybrid environments.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems with elegant cloud-native architectures. I’ve been fortunate to work on and establish several mainstream technologies while they were young — from AWS Transit Gateways and Landing zone implementations to designing and implementing an MLOPS platform, with Azure Machine Learning and Azure Data Lake services.

When I’m not building infrastructure, I’m exploring innovations at the intersection of AI, DevOps, and cloud transformation. Or I would be occupied with with gardening, kickboxing or traveling - which are always part of my world :)

Whether it’s tech, philosophy, or fitness- I’m deeply obsessed with the fundamentals of everything. So I’m always eager to listen, learn, and contribute. After all, the great minds on this world are known for what they did, so it's inevitable that your work is always a masterpiece.

### Current Role

Currently, I'm leading cloud infrastructure strategy at **Cognizant Technology Solutions Canada**, helping clients modernize their development platforms, creating new cloud solutions and maturing CI/CD processes.
