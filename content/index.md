Hi, I'm **Tarvinder Singh** — a Cloud Architect and DevOps Leader with over 11 years of experience delivering scalable, automated cloud solutions across AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments.

I specialize in:

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM)
- GitOps and CI/CD automation (ArgoCD, GitHub Actions)
- Cloud cost optimization and security
- Cross-functional leadership and stakeholder collaboration
- AI/ML integration into cloud-native solutions

Currently, I'm leading cloud infrastructure strategy at **Cognizant Technology Solutions Canada**, helping enterprises modernize their platforms and adopt DevOps best practices.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems with elegant cloud-native architectures.

When I’m not building infrastructure, I’m exploring innovations at the intersection of AI, DevOps, and cloud transformation.
